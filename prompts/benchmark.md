The JSON files contain conversations with different AI models (as indicated in the file name). These conversations test the function calling capabilities of each model. I want you to judge the response based on the following parameters:

1. Instruction adherence: did the model use the correct format specified in the system prompt (first user message of the conversation) to invoke functions? Did it follow the function specification while invoking the function?
2. Function selection: did the model choose the function most appropriate in response to the user's query? Did it make up a function on its own, or use only the given functions?
3. Parameter extraction: did the user extract and use correct parameters from the user's query? Did it hallucinate or make unreasonable guesses?  When a required parameter is not given by the user, did it ask for clarification as instructed?
4. Graceful failure: did the model recognize when a request could not be fulfilled using functions? Did it attempt to provide a reasonable answer itself, or inform the user that it could not help, instead of forcing a function call?
5. Parallel function calling: was the model able to call functions in parallel? Was it able to handle the responses arriving asynchronously?
6. Composite function calling: was the model able to use the output of one function call to call another function?
7. Planning and reasoning: was the model able to handle all queries reasonably? Did it plan out what information it needed, what functions to call (in parallel or in sequence?) and how it would use the function outputs to generate a user-friendly response? Did it lay out its thinking properly as instructed? Did it use the 3 options to decide what response to produce?
8. Output accuracy: was the final response to the user accurate? Did it answer the user's question satisfactorily? Was it user-friendly, or did it just show the user the response of the function directly?
9. Latency: how long did it take for the model to return the full response?

Give each model a score on each of the above parameters - from 0 (horrible) to 5 (excellent) - and an overall score. Justify your score by citing parts of the conversation and the definition of each parameter. If you do not have enough information to score a model on a certain parameter, mention the same and give examples of prompts that would allow you to test the model on that parameter.

Do not skip any model, generate reports for each of them.
